# Research Plan (0→1)

## Objectives
- Validate demand density and safety expectations per zone.
- Understand venue onboarding friction and payout expectations.

## Methods
1. **Classroom & Society Surveys** (quant; Google Forms/Typeform)
2. **Intercept Interviews** (players at parks/metros; 10–15 mins)
3. **Diary Study** (5 teams for 2 weeks; booking + play logs)
4. **School Admin Interviews** (ops + payout + safety checklists)

## Artifacts
- Survey questionnaire (players; admins)
- Screener & consent scripts
- Interview guides & thematic analysis template

## Sample Questions (Players)
- How do you find grounds today? What’s hardest?
- What makes a venue feel safe? Which signals matter most?
- How far will you travel? What’s a fair hourly price?

## Sample Questions (Admins)
- Who currently uses your ground and when?
- What’s your ideal payout cadence? Policies for refunds/cancellations?
- Safety measures already in place? What would improve trust?
