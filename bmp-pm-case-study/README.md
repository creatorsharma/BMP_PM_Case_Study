# BookMyPlay — Product Management Case Study

This repository showcases my PM thinking, artifacts, and execution plan for **BookMyPlay (BMP)** — a platform to book nearby school/college grounds for sports. It includes market insights, PM artifacts (PRD, KPI tree, OKRs, roadmap), analytics plan, and an experiment backlog.

> Tagline: *"BookMyPlay: Where Passion Prevails!"*

## At-a-glance
- **Problem**: Sports grounds are expensive, far, hard to discover/book, and sometimes feel unsafe (esp. for women).
- **Solution**: A local-first booking marketplace for nearby school grounds with flexible slots, transparent pricing, and safety features.
- **Pilot traction**: Partnered with 2 schools (Dayanand Model School, Queens Global International School), ran 3-month turf pilots, earned **INR 4,00,000 in revenue**, and **shared 70% of profits with school management** — profitable from Day 1 without an app, paid marketing, or a formal digital platform.
- **Commercial note**: Post-pilot, schools required **₹15–20L** capex for upgrades and were cautious about long leases; BMP preferred **5-year lock-ins** and **10–15 year leases** with a monthly rent cap of **₹40k–₹50k**.
- **Vision (deal pathways)**: Either the **school invests and becomes partner (70% revenue share)** during the contract and **becomes sole owner of 100% profits** at contract end while BMP switches to a commission-per-booking model; or **BMP funds capex and leases the ground for ~10 years exclusively**, with rent set by market/pricing and exclusivity to BMP post-contract.
-  **Cash flow lever**: Daytime sub-leasing to football academies (Mon–Fri, 3–6 PM winters / 4–7 PM summers) at ~₹40k/month → halves effective rent burden (from ₹80k).
