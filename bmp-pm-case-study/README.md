# BookMyPlay — Product Management Case Study

This repository showcases my PM thinking, artifacts, and execution plan for **BookMyPlay (BMP)** — a platform to book nearby school/college grounds for sports. It includes market insights, PM artifacts (PRD, KPI tree, OKRs, roadmap), analytics plan, and an experiment backlog.

> Tagline: *"BookMyPlay: Where Passion Prevails!"*

## At-a-glance
- **Pilot traction**: Partnered with 2 schools, ran 3-month turf pilots, earned **INR 4L in revenue**, shared 65% with schools — **profitable from Day 1 without an app or paid marketing**.
- **Problem**: Sports grounds are either expensive, far, hard to discover/ book, or feel unsafe for many (esp. women).
- **Solution**: A local-first booking marketplace for nearby school grounds with flexible slots, transparent pricing, and safety features.
- **Model**: Commission-based with school partners.
- **North Star**: Monthly Paid Play Slots (MPPS).
