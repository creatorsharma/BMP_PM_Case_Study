# BookMyPlay — PM Case Study

## 1) Context & Problem
In Delhi NCR, students and local players struggle to find convenient, affordable, and safe grounds to play. Pain points include:
- **High fees & memberships** at existing facilities.
- **Distance & access**: many grounds are on the outskirts, raising time and travel costs.
- **Discovery**: there’s often *no simple way* to book a nearby ground.
- **Safety & inclusivity**: women frequently face unwelcoming environments and opaque policies.

**Opportunity**: Aggregate *nearby* school/college grounds into a flexible booking marketplace with transparent pricing and safety features.

## 2) Target Market & Sizing (Top-down)
- Students in Delhi (Classes 6–12): **~1.7M**.
- No. of private schools in Delhi: **~1,014**.
- Initial serviceable segment: private school students/nearby residents.
- Hypothesis: A fraction of students + local adult amateurs drive recurring bookings, esp. evenings/weekends.

## 3) Users, Personas & JTBD
**Primary users**
- Student groups (13–18): price-sensitive, time-bound, prefer nearby slots.
- Young working adults (22–35): convenience-focused, willing to pay for prime time.
- Women players: value verified venues, lighting, CCTV, female-only slots.
- School admins: seek incremental revenue, utilization, and low operational burden.
- Coaches/academies: recurring bookings and scheduling blocks.

**Sample persona: Aisha (22, marketing associate)**
- Commutes 60–90 mins daily; plays twice a week with friends.
- Needs safe, well-lit grounds near home or metro.
- Frustrated by opaque booking and last-minute cancellations.
- Will pay a small premium for reliability and reviews.

**Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)**
- *When my friends are free*, I want to **find and book a nearby ground in minutes**, so that **we actually play this week**.
- *When I’m booking as a woman*, I want **clear safety signals & female-friendly options**, so I **feel comfortable and secure**.
- *When I manage a school ground*, I want **seamless slot management and payouts**, so I **earn without admin headaches**.

## 4) Solution Overview
**Core experience**
1) **Search by Area** → 2) **Browse Listings + Reviews** → 3) **Book & Pay** → 4) **Check-in** → 5) **Rate & Rebook**

**Key value props**
- Easy access to *nearby* venues
- Flexible booking (hourly slots)
- Safer play (verified venues, lighting, guardianship contact, reporting)
- Affordable options & discounts
- School partners earn incremental revenue

**MVP Scope (v1)**
- Venue search (distance, price, sport), slot calendar, online pay, booking receipt.
- Venue onboarding portal (manual → CSV import), photo upload, slot & price config.
- Trust features: verified badge, lighting indicator, women-friendly slots, reviews.
- Cancellations + refund rules; support workflow (chat/email).

## 5) Business Model (Marketplace)
- **Commission** on each booking paid by the player; revenue share to schools.
- Example economics to validate:
  - Avg fee per hour: ~₹1,500.
  - BMP take per booking (after share): ~₹600 (illustrative).
  - Bookings per ground/month: 100–150 (varies by facility, peak times).
  - Revenue per ground/month: ₹60,000–₹150,000 (BMP share).

Assumptions must be tested on pilots with 3–5 schools before scaling.

## 6) Competitive Landscape
- **Playo, Huddle, Cult Academy** — strong for urban sports discovery/booking. BMP differentiates on *local-first school inventory*, *safety emphasis*, and *pricing transparency*.

## 7) Go-To-Market (0→1)
- **Supply first**: onboard 10–15 schools in 2 zones; ensure photo-quality and verified safety info.
- **Demand seeding**: host inter-school/community events; create content around women-in-sport & safety; leverage micro-influencers.
- **Ground truth**: class-to-class surveys, WhatsApp groups, society captains, coaching centers.
- **Distribution loop**: every booking prompts “invite friends” & referral credits.

## 8) Metrics & North Star
**North Star**: **Monthly Paid Play Slots (MPPS)**.

**Input metrics**
- Acquisition: new users, CAC, virality K.
- Activation: search → listing view → slot select → pay success (funnel conversion).
- Supply: active venues, prime-time slot availability, slot fill rate.
- Retention: repeat bookings (D30), cohort curves, NPS.
- Monetization: take rate, AOV, gross margin, cancellations/refunds.

## 9) Risks & Mitigations
- **Chicken-and-egg**: zone-focused rollout, guaranteed minimums for pilot schools.
- **Safety incidents**: verified venues, SOS in-app, support SLAs, incident response playbook.
- **No-shows & cancellations**: deposits, clear policies, waitlist auto-fill.
- **Seasonality/weather**: covered/indoor options, dynamic pricing, off-peak bundles.
- **Ops overhead**: simple onboarding, templates, payout automation, SLA-based support tiers.

## 11) Pilot & Early Traction

To validate supply-demand fit, we partnered with two schools in Delhi NCR:

- **Dayanand Model School**  
- **Queens Global International School**

**Contract Structure:** 3-month agreements with both schools where BMP managed bookings and operations, while schools received **65% of profits**.

**Execution (no app, no paid marketing):**
- Created dedicated WhatsApp groups to fill daily cricket & football slots.  
- Organized on-ground **corporate tournaments** and **intra-school events**.  
- Managed slot scheduling manually via spreadsheets and WhatsApp confirmations.  

**Results (3-month pilot):**
- **INR 4 Lakhs earned** from tournaments + daily bookings.  
- Profitable **from Day 1**, even with 65% school revenue share.  
- 100% of demand was acquired **organically** — via networks, events, and WhatsApp virality.  

This traction demonstrated **clear demand density** and strong **school partner alignment**, validating BMP’s marketplace hypothesis even without a formal app or digital campaigns.

## 10) Learnings & Next
- Validate *zone-level density*: supply breadth and peak-time coverage matter more than total city count.
- Safety and trust cues are decisive for female cohorts; keep doubling down.
- Monetization expands with teams/academies (block bookings) and value-added services (equipment, coaching).
